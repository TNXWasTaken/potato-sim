    â˜… Welcome to Potato Simulator! â˜…

How to Play:
Begin by clicking the green play button(and the arrow). Once your loaded into the game, click on your planting space to plant potato sprouts. After a couple of seconds (7 to 10 seconds), your sprouts will grow into potatoes! once your sprout is a potato, click on it to collect coins. Use your coins in the shop to get more planting space or chests. Chests give you new potatoes that you can find in your inventory (duplicitous of potatoes will not give anything). Click on the potatoes in your inventory to use them. Once using a potato, all potato sprouts will grow into that potato! All potatoes have a rarity. Common potatoes have a blue circle behind them in your inventory, rare potatoes have a yellow circle behind them, epic ones have a purple circle behind them, legendary have a circle that is a gold gradient and specials have a blue and green gradient circle. The better the potato, the more coins it gives you you can also click the arrows in the inventory to go to the different pages and spider potato is the best potato kinda impure potato can give more but spider is more reliable fun fact impure potato has 1.953125e+15 (what ever that number is) diffrent possible outputs if you have a full farm
